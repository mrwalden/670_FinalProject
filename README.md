# 670_FinalProject

This project is about analyzing tweets from and involving major Sports Networks to see what makes these accounts successful and their tweets popular. 

In order to completely run this you must unzip the SNtwitterdata.zip file. 

The ImportTweets.ipynb file is the script we used to gather the tweets from the three different networks and save them into CSV format. The CSV files we created are already placed in this folder so there is no need to Import Tweets again.
